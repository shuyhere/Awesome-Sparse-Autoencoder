  "**Feature visualization** answers questions about what a network or parts of a network are looking for by generating examples.

  Neural networks are, generally speaking, differentiable with respect to their inputs. If we want to find out what kind of input would cause a certain behavior,whether thatâ€™s an internal neuron firing or the final output behavior,we can use derivatives to iteratively tweak the input towards that goal."
* [Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) (March 10, 2020)
  "By studying the **connections between neurons**, we can find meaningful algorithms in the weights of neural networks."
